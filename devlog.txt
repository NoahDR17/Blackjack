set up navbar first for index.html file, then duplicate the file twice and make them the rules page
and the game page.

issues: 
dealt dealers cards after checking for scores and deciding who won, resulting in it checking who won before 
had been dealt his full hand.
fixed by moving that section of code above the part checking the scores.

rules page reset game when viewing it.
fixed by adding a modal pop up of the rules instead of taking you to the rules page.

moved all js code for game page into a new index.js file, so that when calling for a get element by id it 
doesnt throw a null error because page is open on a html document that doesnt contain those id's, like 
rules page and the home page.

add function for reset game instead of just refreshing page, 
errors
scores wouldnt reset, result would reset.
player would be dealt two cards evrey time resetgame was called, because in that func is start game, which 
deals the players two starting cards, fix was to set the html of the player-cards div to empty again, because
while the javascript values may have reset the html dom hadnt, meaning the previously appended images from old
rounds where still inside the dealer/player-cards 
to fix scores and result i jusst set their values to 0 again inside the resetGame func 

why make reset game func? 


asset paths in index and game are different ./assets/ vs assets/

should not have to click stay when bust

rules text is duplicated

have a section explaining how i did the javascript
