set up navbar first for index.html file, then duplicate the file twice and make them the rules page
and the game page.

issues: 
dealt dealers cards after checking for scores and deciding who won, resulting in it checking who won before 
had been dealt his full hand.
fixed by moving that section of code above the part checking the scores.

rules page reset game when viewing it.
fixed by adding a modal pop up of the rules instead of taking you to the rules page.
