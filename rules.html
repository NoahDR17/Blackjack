        <div id="rules-content">
            <br>
            <p>In blackjack, the objective is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Each card has a value:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value.</li>
                <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.</li>
                <li>Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what's more advantageous for the player's
                    hand.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The game begins with each player, being dealt two cards. The dealer has one card face up and one card
                face down.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Players then have the option to "hit" (receive another card from the dealer) or "stand" (keep their
                current hand). If a player's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Once all players have chosen to stand, the dealer reveals their face-down card and must hit until their
                hand reaches a value of 17 or higher.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If the dealer busts, remaining players win. If neither busts, the one with the highest hand value wins.
                In a tie, it's a push, and the player's bet is returned.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Special plays include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Split: If a player's first two cards are of the same value, they can split them into two separate
                    hands.</li>
                <li>Double Down: Players may double their original bet and receive one more card.</li>
                <li>Insurance: Available when the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, it's a side bet that pays 2:1 if the
                    dealer has a blackjack.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>A player gets a blackjack if their first two cards are an Ace and a 10-value card. They typically win 1.5
                times their bet unless the dealer also has a blackjack, resulting in a push.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To win:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have a hand closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding it.</li>
                <li>If the dealer's hand is closer to 21, the player loses their bet.</li>
                <li>In case of a tie, the player's bet is returned.</li>
            </ul>
